<!--
  The RouterOutlet is one of the router directives that became available to the
  AppComponent because AppModule imports AppRoutingModule which exported RouterModule.
  The ng generate command you ran at the start of this tutorial added this import because
  of the --module=app flag. If you didn't use the ng generate command to create
  app-routing.module.ts, import AppRoutingModule into app.module.ts and add it to the
  imports array of the NgModule. -->
